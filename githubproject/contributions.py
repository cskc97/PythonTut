# Contributions are counted as follows -
# Issues, pull requests, forks, commits

#Getting commits as follows -
# https://api.github.com/users/cskc97/repos - will give a list of all repos
# for each repo name we will then have to call https://api.github.com/repos/cskc97/PythonTut/stats/commit_activity
# where pythotut will be replaced by the repo name
# the resulting array would span 365 days and have all the commits for each of those 365 days
